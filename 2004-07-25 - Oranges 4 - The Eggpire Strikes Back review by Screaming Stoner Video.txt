The independent film industry can often be a show case for unbelievable creativity.
Oranges 4: The Eggpire Strikes Back (1999) from GMP Pictures is a short that exemplifies such creativity and could be filmed on even the smallest budget.
The heroes are oranges while the villains are made up of  a variety of Easter candy, bunnies and other accessories.
The storyline is basic; the evil Easter Bunny has invaded the Oranges' home planet.
The sets are simple and yet at the same time brilliant.
This short has everything from gory, OJ-covered battles, to marshmallow bunnies firing off their cannons.
You really just have to check this out for yourself to understand what I am saying.
The film quality was excellent as well as the editing.
We could never catch a human behind the scenes, in other words: Get this on GMP Collection Volume 2!
