Alright just doin' my rounds on the webring.
If ya don't already know REwind issue 1 is done and ready for order so get your copy and lets us know what you think of it and how to improve it for next time.
If you want to submit for R2 which hopefully should be done before 2000 rolls around just send us anything from interviews, trailers, b-roll from your movies, and stories, We take almost any format vhs, s-vhs, betacam, betacam sp, betacam sx, one inch reel (but don't send 1 inch I hate feeding the machine), vcd, and dvd.
send if you want to or don't at least get R1 and watch it. cheers. Wally..

A nice little site. I like to support all low and no budget film makers, I've been there myself and know what it's like. I've got plenty of horror stories. Good luck with your films. Also, thanks for joining the B-Film news and discussion list.
