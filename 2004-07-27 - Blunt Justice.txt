Blunt Justice

Blunt Justice (1999) from GMP Pictures is something of a 90 minute spoof on "The Fugitive".
What this picture doesn't have is Harrison Ford and a HUGE budget.
What this film does have is gut-wrenching humor and a subtle genius that kept our eyes glued.
Written by Rich Evans and Mike Stoklasa and directed by Mike Stoklasa this movie has everything from talking dolls to a cameo appearance from Monkey Man himself.
Take this demented journey with Willy, MooShoo and Nannoo and you will find yourself wondering, "What drugs are these guys on?"
A truly entertaining film that centers around MooShoo the Alien, who crash lands on Earth and must fight for his vindication amongst Bounty Hunters and extra-terrestrial corporate slime balls.
We can't wait to see the next offering from this small, yet talented company.
Available on VHS!
