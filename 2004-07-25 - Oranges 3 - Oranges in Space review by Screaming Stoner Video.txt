In the continuing saga of the Orange species, comes Oranges 3: Oranges in Space (1999).
This 15 minute short from the fun-loving guys at GMP Pictures  chronicles more of the struggles our fruit heroes must endure in their never-ending quest for peace.
Well, at least the ability to make juice without a lot of annoying intrusions!
In this episode, the oranges have to go up against the evil Eggplant leader who has kidnapped their princess.
The quality was a little sloppy compared to Oranges 4, i.e. you can see a bit more evidence of the humans behind the scenes.
The Eggplant villain was very well done and the overall storyline was amusing.
Perhaps, these shorts get better as they go along, which only makes us look forward to the other sequels.
Again, you can get this on GMP Collection Volume 2.
Go get this video today!
