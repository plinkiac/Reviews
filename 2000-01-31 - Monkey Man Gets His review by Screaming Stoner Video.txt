Monkey Man Gets His review by Screaming Stoner Video

Sometimes we see a film that is an example of what NOT to do when making a film.
Monkey Man Gets His (1999) is one bad trip! There really is no storyline in this 15 minute short from GMP Pictures.
All we basically got out of the deal is that some ape-like creature lives with his annoying mother and has a slight pill-popping problem.
The short was filmed like a hallucination, with weird incoherent dialogue, bad shot choices and unimpressive effects.
This short could be used in Film Making 101, to show newbies how to make a disaster.
Man, we hate to be so harsh but this film killed our buzz and made our heads hurt.
Not all of GMP's work is like this, see our above reviews if you want our overall opinion on their art.
This is available on GMP Collection Volume 2, but don't worry the other shorts on that tape are pretty damn good!
