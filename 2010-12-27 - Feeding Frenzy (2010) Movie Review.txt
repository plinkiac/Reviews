Feeding Frenzy (2010) Movie Review
https://archive.is/LQXXY (horrorphilia.com)

Plot-Some strange things are happening at Jesse Camp’s job.
They involve a boss and a mysterious box in the basement.
One Night Jesse, a girl he has a crush on named Christine and her boyfriend Kyle decide to investigate and upon opening the box they find little creatures.
This film is a homage tongue and cheek all the way to Gremlins, Critters, Ghoulies, and all those rubber puppet monster movies.

Review-First off thanks to Jeff at Cinema Head Cheese who introduced this film to me.
This film is played for laughs, and unlike a lot of comedy horror films, this has more hits than misses.
There is some blood and gore but its really a background to this homage of 80′s puppet creature movies.
If this film came out in 87, when it seemed like weekly we had some Ghoulies, or Gremlins offshoot coming out, it would have been so much more successful.
Today, it feels like a nostalgic love letter to the 80′s.
I thought the dialogue was fun, and the humor at time was so dark and morbid.
This film has so much heart that you cannot hate it.
Would I recommend it to the people who love Hostel or Saw, no, they will shit on it and hate it.
I would recommend it to someone who had a bad day at work or is having a bad time right now, and needs a pick me up film that would get a few smiles and smirks.
The end is so ridiculous that its watchable for its absurdity.
I like this film, and while I know a lot of podcasts and websites have gave this film top 10 praise, I can see their love.
But, for me it was at times, sort of slow and some of the jokes and moments seemed to fail and just stop the flow of the film.
But, again I did like this and could recommend it.
